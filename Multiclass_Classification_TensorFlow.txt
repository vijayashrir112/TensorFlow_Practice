Develope a multiclass image classficiation model using Convolutional Neural Network and TensorFlow API on Python

The given dataset contain 5200 training images of 4 classes and 1267 testing images.
Extract files from multiclass_datasets.rar.
train_data_bi.npy is containing 5200 training photos with labels
test_data_bi.npy is containing 1267 testing photos with labels.
Classes are chair & kitchen & knife & saucepan. Classes are equal(1300 glass - 1300 kitchen - 1300 knife- 1300 saucepan) on training data.
